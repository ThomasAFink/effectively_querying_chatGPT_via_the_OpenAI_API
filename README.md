# Effectively Querying ChatGPT via the OpenAI API

Basically ChatGPT is a wee bit more creative database you can use to help approach problems a traditional search engine cannot solve. For example maybe you need a description of something or a third opinion. Another usecase is of course fictional writing. Any factual answers received should be taken with a grain of salt at this point because they are still often incorrect. The following code tries to demonstrate how query ChatGPT more effectively.

## Our List of 20 Companies in Munich

We going through a list of companies and generate a description, keywords, a stock market symbol, and location using ChatGPT-3. All companies are actually located in Munich Germany, some are subsidaries. So you can gauge the accuracy from that.

## Installation and Setting Things up

You don't need a ChatGPT pro account to access the api. They are two different products billed seperately.

        "Please note that the ChatGPT API is not included in the ChatGPT Plus subscription and are billed separately. The API has its own pricing, which can be found at https://openai.com/pricing. The ChatGPT Plus subscription covers usage on chat.openai.com only and costs $20/month."

You can get an api token at: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 
Each query costs a small few cent fee but the first $18.00 are a free trial: https://openai.com/pricing
Monitor your usage at: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage

## Diving Into the Python Code

Before starting we need to install OpenAI Python library:

        pip3 install os
        pip3 install csv
        pip3 install openai
        pip3 install time

Then to start our file we need to import our installed packages:

        import os
        import csv
        import openai
        import time

The first section of the code sets the API key for accessing OpenAI's GPT-3 model, and defines the file paths for the input and output CSV files that will be used to store the data. 

        openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY"

        OS_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath('__file__'))
        input_csv_file_path = OS_PATH + "/data/munich_company_list_input.csv"
        output_csv_file_path = OS_PATH + "/output/munich_company_list_output.csv"


The next section contains four functions, each of which sends a prompt to GPT-3 and returns the output generated by the model. The structure of these function is generally the same. We use the standard model gpt-3.5-turbo, but other models such as GPT-4 are available as listed on the OpenAI website: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5. To get the results we want we need to be very exact with our prompts.

Max tokens is the character limit for the response. This helps us narrow down precision for the response. The temperature parameter is a hyperparameter that controls the degree of randomness and creativity in the text generated by GPT-3. When the temperature parameter is set to a low value, such as 0.1 as in this code, the generated text will be very conservative and predictable. This means that the text will be more likely to contain common phrases and structures that are found in human language. On the other hand, when the temperature parameter is set to a high value, the generated text will be more creative and unpredictable, and it may contain unexpected phrases, structures, or even errors.

Since the api has a limit of 3 queries per minute we handle this error with a try catch to continue querying.

get_ticker_from_gpt3(company_name): This function prompts GPT-3 to generate the stock market ticker symbol for a given company name. The function creates a conversation between a user and a system in which the user asks for the ticker symbol, and GPT-3 responds with the generated symbol. The returned symbol is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and returned by the function.

        def get_ticker_from_gpt3(company_name):
            messages = [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},

get_keywords_from_gpt3(company_name): This function prompts GPT-3 to generate a list of 50 simple keywords for a given company name. The function creates a conversation between a user and a system in which the user asks for the keywords, and GPT-3 responds with the generated list. The function ensures that there are at least 30 keywords in the list before returning it, and if there are not, it prompts GPT-3 again with the same conversation prompt.

        def get_keywords_from_gpt3(company_name):

                    time.sleep(30)

get_description_from_gpt3(company_name): This function prompts GPT-3 to generate a 190 character limit description for a given company name. The function creates a conversation between a user and a system in which the user asks for the description, and GPT-3 responds with the generated text. The returned text is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and returned by the function.

        def get_description_from_gpt3(company_name):
            messages = [

The start of the description is irrelevant to the actual description, but this prefix counts in the character count. No hashtags.\n \n   {company_name}"}
            ]

get_location_from_gpt3(company_name): This function prompts GPT-3 to generate the location (city, state, country) for a given company name. The function creates a conversation between a user and a system in which the user asks for the location, and GPT-3 responds with the generated text. The returned text is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace and returned by the function.

                    time.sleep(30)

After defining these functions, the code opens the input CSV file and reads the data row by row. For each row, it extracts the company name and passes it to each of the four functions defined earlier to generate the ticker symbol, keywords, description, and location. Each generated value is added to the corresponding column in the output CSV file.

        def main():
            GPTModel = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

            with open(input_csv_file_path, mode='r') as input_csvfile:
                reader = csv.DictReader(input_csvfile)
                
                with open(output_csv_file_path, mode='w', newline='') as output_csvfile:
                    fieldnames = reader.fieldnames
                    writer = csv.DictWriter(output_csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
                    writer.writeheader()

                    for row in reader:

                        company_name = row['Name']

                        print("\n")
                        print("******************************* "+ company_name + " ************************************")

                        ticker = get_ticker_from_gpt3(company_name, GPTModel)
                        print("Ticker : " + ticker)
                        row['Ticker'] = ticker
                        print("-------------------------------------------------------------------")

                        keywords = get_keywords_from_gpt3(company_name, GPTModel)
                        print("Keywords : " + keywords)

## The Output Generated From ChatGPT-3

## A Short Summary
This code shows an example of how to effectively query ChatGPT using the OpenAI API. It defines four functions that prompt GPT-3 to generate a stock market ticker symbol, keywords, a description, and a location for a given company name. These functions use a conversation between a user and a system, and the generated outputs are added to an output CSV file.
